Credit card fraud detection analysis using Machine learning models

The main objective of the customer churn analysis is to predict that if the customer will continue with the services offered by the company or if the customer will quit.

The steps involved in the project are:

1.exploring the dataset also visualizing as well as cleaning the data set .

2.Data preprocessing

3.building machine learning models

4.evaluating the models

5.tuning the parameters for better accuracy

6.upsampling- Upsampling (balanced): decide how many times the sample size of the minority class wants to be used and perform sampling with replacement in the minority class and sampling without replacement in the majority class.

7.final model creation and analysis outcome.

for better accuracy results adaboost classifier is used

AdaBoost is easy to implement. It iteratively corrects the mistakes of the weak classifier and improves accuracy by combining weak learners.
